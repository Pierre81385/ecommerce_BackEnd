# ecommerce_BackEnd

A backend using Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL to perform CRUD operations on a database for an e-commerce site.

# Instructions

- Copy and run database schema in the "db" folder to create the database.
- Seed the database by running "npm run seed" in the terminal.
- Initiate server connection by running "node server.js" in the terminal.

Useing Insomnia, the user can test routes by sending GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests.

The desired responses can be viewed in Insomnia and the MySQL database.

# Note

While all of the responses seemed to function correctly, I could not figure out why my delete requests all returned
a 500 error despite performing the proper outcome in the database.
